# Operating Systems Read-Ahead Optimization

## About This Project
This project focuses on predictive modeling to enhance data prefetching in file systems, improving overall efficiency and performance.

## Built With
- **PintOS**: Educational operating system framework.
- **Python**: Data analysis and modeling.
- **C++**: System-level programming.
- **Linux**: Development and testing environment.

## Features
- Implemented predictive algorithms for read-ahead optimization.
- Enhanced file system performance through efficient data prefetching.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository and set up the PintOS environment.
2. Compile and run the optimized file system:
   ```bash
   make
   pintos run <test-program>
